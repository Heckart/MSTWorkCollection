The following classes have involved some form of programming. All of it (that I wrote) is hosted in this repository.

## COMP ENG 3150 Introduction to Microcontrollers and Embedded System Design (LEC 3.0)
### Microcontroller-based digital system design methodology and techniques. Topics include basic machine organization, interface design, and C and assembly language programming for real-time embedded systems. Prerequisites: COMP ENG 2210 and COMP SCI 1570 (or programming equivalent) each with grade of "C" or better.
**Languages used: AVR Assembly & C**

## COMP SCI 1200 Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science (LEC 3.0)
### This course provides a rigorous treatment of topics from discrete mathematics which are essential to computer science. Principal topics include: formal logic (propositional & predicate), set theory, proof techniques, mathematical induction, program correctness, combinatorics, discrete probability, relations, functions, matrices, and graph theory. Prerequisite: A grade of "C" or better in either Comp Sci 1500 or Comp Sci 1570 and in one of Math 1120, Math 1140, Math 1208, Math 1210, Math 1211, or Math 1214.
**Languages used: Python**

## COMP SCI 1570 Introduction To C++ Programming (LEC 3.0)
### Object-Oriented Programming design and development in C++. Emphasis placed on good programming practices. Topics include syntax/semantics, operators, control flow/decision branching, memory management, functions, file I/O, C-strings, arrays, pointers, classes, templates, inheritance, polymorphism, and exception handling. This course is programming intensive. Prerequisites: A grade of "C" or better in Comp Sci 1500 or in both of Comp Sci 1971 and Comp Sci 1981, and accompanied by Comp Sci 1580.
**Languages used: C++**

## COMP SCI 1575 Data Structures (LEC 3.0)
### A continuation of Object-Oriented Programming, with emphasis on the efficient organization of data through Abstract Data Types and Data Structures. Topics include Linked Lists, Vectors, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Hash Tables, Graphs and their use in a variety of algorithms. Recursive programming techniques are also covered. This course is programming intensive. Prerequisite: Grade of "C" or better in Comp Sci 1570.
**Languages used: C++**

## COMP SCI 1580 Introduction To Programming Laboratory (LAB 1.0)
### Practical applications of concepts learned in Computer Science 1570. Hands-on instruction in C++ developing, debugging, and testing programming projects. Prerequisite: Accompanied by Comp Sci 1570.
**Langauges used: C++**

## COMP SCI 1585 Data Structures Laboratory (LAB 1.0)
### Hands-on instruction in programming development tools such as version control systems, integrated development environments, debuggers, profilers, and event-based programming environments. Exercises will complement the concepts presented in Comp Sci 1575. Prerequisite: Preceded or accompanied by Comp Sci 1575.
**Languages used: Bash, C++, & Make**
